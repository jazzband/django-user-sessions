Django User Sessions's Documentation
====================================

Django includes excellent built-in sessions, however all the data is hidden
away into base64 encoded data. This makes it very difficult to run a query on
all active sessions for a particular user. `django-user-sessions` fixes this
and makes session objects a first class citizen like other ORM objects.
